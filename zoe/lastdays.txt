The last few days of Zoe's life were not great. A few nights before her last day Lisa saw that Zoe was walking funny on her nightly outing. She called me over to see what I thought. I thought that I might be a medication that she was on and we decided we would sleep on it. 
I woke up in the middle of the night and heard Zoe trying to get up on the bed. It was extremely scary for me because she would jump and then flop about because her back legs had basically deserted her at this point. She just didn’t have any control of them. So, I immediately work Lisa up and we went to the pet emergency room at 4 in the morning or so on a Monday. 
There we were told it could be any number of things, an inflamed disk, a neurological disorder, etc. They kept her there and did some tests. When I got off work I went to petsmart to get her a cage. It was recommended that we didn't let her move around. So, we put her in the cage and she was ok. I feel bad about this part of the story because I accidentally caught her tail with the cage's door that night and she still had feeling in it. 
The next day was her last. She stopped being able to go to the bathroom, which really meant whatever was going on was extremely serious. Zoe also seemed very concerned and nervous about not being able to control her back legs. We could have opted for surgery, but decided that it wasn’t worth it for Zoe to go through all the pain and suffering that would be associated with that. And it was also extremely expensive. So, I got of early that day. I then got Zoe out of her cage that was set up on the bed and held her for about an hour (I also gave her a lot of treats). 
Lisa and I took her to the vet and were with her when she was put down. Zoe seemed OK, she was less nervous but Lisa and I were messes. It would have been better if we had the vet come to us (which we tried, but she didn’t call us back). It was likely one of the hardest things I will ever do. I miss Zoe.
