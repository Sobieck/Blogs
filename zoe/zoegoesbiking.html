<p>Lisa and I used to bike ride quite a bit. We live a few houses from the MKT Trail but we would also feel bad about leaving Zoe at home. She had pretty bad separation anxiety.</p>

<p>So, Lisa bought a basket to put on the front of my bike. I didn't think that it would work. Zoe hated going in the <a href="index.php/191-zoe-goes-kayaking">Kayak</a> so I figured that she would also hate going in a basket with more disastrous consequences. But we trained her but just putting her in it on the floor quite a few times and then walking around with her in it. This worked! We then were able to bike with her anywhere. She loved to see people and dogs. She would even get excited when she knew we were leaving. If she saw a dog and we went by it she would strain to look at it behind us (she was restrained by a leash latch to her harness).</p>
