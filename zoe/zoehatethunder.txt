Zoe hated thunderstorms. If we were outside right before a thunderstorm and thunder sounds Zoe would take off at full speed in the direction of the thunder. She would not allow that aggression to stand. She would kill the perpetrator.

This was a problem though. When she was inside while thunderstorms were happening she would pace, hyperventilate and just generally freak out. This was extremely disturbing for everyone involved. We lost tons of sleep due to this. Lisa and I would divide the responsibility to comfort her. One of us would take her into the guest room and just tell her things were going to be ok and hold her. Eventually we were able to get some sedatives that we would give her to ease her suffering.
