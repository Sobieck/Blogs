Zoe used to love spending time with us on the bed. She would normally settle at the bottom of the bed and be content with that when we were laying in bed reading or whatnot. However, when Lisa or I would call her Zoe would always come to us. The problem was that she would go to the person that didn't call her. I don't know why she did this. But without fail she would do that.
