When Zoe was feeling like she needed to play and we were in the den, she would go to her toy basket and start pulling out toys. She was trying to entice her people to play with her. We would then go along with her and play. She liked to play tug of war primarily and she would play a pretty primitive form of fetch. We would throw the toy into the dining room and then she would run to the living room we would chase her and then she would run to the dining room. This was the height of entertainment for her but it would get pretty monotonous for us.
