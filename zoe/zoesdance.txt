Zoe had to find the perfect spot to poop. She would take about 5 or 6 minutes crouched over shuffling in circles until she found the perfect spot. I don't know what the perfect spot was, but I know for sure that the grass had to be not very long. This was hilarious.
She was also a shy pooper. She tended to try to get away from her humans before doing the deed. Which meant that she was hard to potty train when we got her home from the Humane Society. She would sneak off into corners of closets or unused rooms to go in the house.
