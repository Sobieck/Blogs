Lisa and I drive a Honda Accord and we would take Zoe pretty much everywhere with us (I mean, you can't leave a dog at home can you?). Zoe enjoyed this quite a bit. She would sit on the center console right in between us and look out the front windshield. It was the perfect height. She became quite the expert at not falling off of it when moving. She could handle a fast turn, acceleration, etc. The only thing she would need someone to brace her for was if we stopped very suddenly. There were a few times where she would go and lay in the back window on very long trips, but normally we would make a very comfortable bed for her in the back seat.

As part of these trips out, we would sometime have to leave her in the car due to society's constraints on sweet little doggies. So, in those cases we would go and she would wait for us in the back window. She would look out patiently until she saw us then freak out a little bit.
