Zoe didn't like getting wet. She hated wet grass, rain and her weekly baths.

Early in Zoe's life with us we went to Michigan to see my parents at their lake cottage. They have kayaks which all of their Scottie dogs loved to go in. Those dogs would sit in your lap and just enjoy the view of the shore and the smells of the water.

Zoe did not enjoy the experience of kayaking. We took her out and she was immediately pretty skittish. We had to keep her restrained, and we were only able to go for a little bit. When we were about 3 feet from the shore I stopped restraining her and she jumped into the water, swam to the shore, and ran at top speed all the way up to the cottage.
