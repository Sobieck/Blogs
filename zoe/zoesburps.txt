As I've previously mentioned in the blog, Zoe loved people food. I'm pretty sure that she would have gladly killed her mommy or I if it meant that she got just a little more people food. 

But, for her dinners at night Lisa would give her normal dog bisques which Zoe didnâ€™t appreciate. So since Lisa and I are suckers we would mix in a little wet dog food into the dry. This was extremely satisfying for Zoe and she would eat them without taking her head out of her food. Lisa and I would normally be in a different room by the end of the feeding frenzy, but we would always be able to tell when she was done by the enormous burp that Zoe would perpetrate at the end of the meal.
