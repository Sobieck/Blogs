For most of Zoe's life with us I worked from home. I would take her on her walk every day. She would sleep next to me while I worked on my computer. We occasionally played. Basically we were always with each other. 

The last 4 months of her life I worked at an office. This was apparently pretty distressing for her for the first few weeks. However, she eventually figured out that I would come home at around 5. She would stand on a chair looking out the window at around 4:30 and then freak out when I got home. She would run around barking and begging for attention.
