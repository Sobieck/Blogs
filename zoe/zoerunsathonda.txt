Anytime Zoe was outside when Lisa or I got home in the Honda she would just book it towards the car. There was nothing more exciting to her than seeing one of us after we'd been gone.

I remember specifically one time when we had first moved into our house. I was sitting out on the porch in the swinging chair when Lisa got home. Zoe heard the Honda and she took off across the yard to greet her mommy. Lisa then had to stop so as to not hit Zoe. Zoe then proceeded to jump into the cab and sit on Lisa's lap while she drove down the driveway.

This sort of thing happened a lot and we always had to exercise some caution when coming home.
