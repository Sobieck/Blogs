TPL -> Processor Bound work. This blocks and should NOT be used for IO. This is extremely useful though for processor bound work. -> Maybe another blog about how to use this effectively.

Async/Await should be used for IO as it is non-blocking. How does this work with MVC? How does it work with WebAPI? Explain Tasks, Task -> void, Task<T> -> T, Conventions -> Async prefix

Benefits: Concurrency, Scalability, and code readability (exception handling etc).

Concurrency improves the Customer's experience and scalability improves the bottom line.

Issues -> It is like a virus in your code. In order for it to be used, the calling code must also be async in the called code is async.

Misconceptions about Async/await, not your traditional thread management. It really is worth it to use this in situations where you are blocking only for a few milliseconds (need sources).

Code smell -> .Result. Await should be used -> I do use it in Unit Tests Though.

TPL example -> why it isn't great at IO.
Async/Await example -> hit an API a lot. WhenAll()
Async/Await example -> fastest stock quote. WhenAny()
