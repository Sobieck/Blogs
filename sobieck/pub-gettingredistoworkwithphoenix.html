Connecting to Redis in a Phoenix Application

Connecting to <a href="http://redis.io/">Redis</a> is surprisingly easy in Phoenix. It was on par with what I would expect in C# when using NuGet. For me the meat of the problem was installing Redis and that was even quite easy since I use <a href="https://chocolatey.org/">Chocolatey</a> for installs. Everything else was just adding a couple of lines to my mix file and config.

The first thing I did was install redis-64 in powershell with the following command:
<pre>  choco install redis-64
</pre>
After that I installed redis as a service on my machine using the following command:
<pre>  redis-server --service-install
</pre>
I then started up a redis-server with following command and verified that Redis was working with the following commands:
<pre>  redis-server
  redis-cli
</pre>

So at this point Redis is working on my local machine. Now it was just a matter of getting Redis to play nice with Phoenix. It looks like the best received Redis client for Elixir is <a href="https://github.com/artemeff/exredis">Exredis</a>. To integrate that into my solution all I had to do was edit my <b>mix.exs</b> file and make a minor change to my dev config file. I just added <b>{:exredis, "&gt;= 0.2.2"}</b> to my deps function and <b>:exredis</b> to my application function.
Here is the what those functions looked like after completion.
<pre>
  defp deps do
    [{:phoenix, "~> 1.0.3"},
     {:phoenix_ecto, "~> 1.1"},
     {:postgrex, ">= 0.0.0"},
     {:phoenix_html, "~> 2.1"},
     {:phoenix_live_reload, "~> 1.0", only: :dev},
     {:cowboy, "~> 1.0"},
     {:comeonin, "~> 1.3"},
     {:exredis, ">= 0.2.2"}]
  end

  def application do
    [mod: {PhoenixDiet, []},
    applications: [:phoenix, :phoenix_html, :cowboy, :logger,
                    :phoenix_ecto, :postgrex, :comeonin, :exredis]]
  end
</pre>
I then added the following to my dev.exs in the config folder of my solution:
<pre>  config :exredis,
    host: "localhost",
    port: 6379,
    password: "",
    db: 0,
    reconnect: :no_reconnect,
    max_queue: :infinity
</pre>
I then ran <b>mix deps.get</b> in powershell to get the exredis dependencies and everything was all set up. Now just to write a little code to demonstrate that everything was working.

I made a new controller called RedisController. Basically the controller's functions make connections to Redis and then read or write some data. I don't have connection pooling set up yet but this should happen at some point in the future. It and its routing look like this:
<pre>
defmodule PhoenixDiet.RedisController do
  use PhoenixDiet.Web, :controller
  import Exredis


  def create(conn, %{"key" => key, "value" => value}) do
    {:ok, client} = Exredis.start_link

    client |> Exredis.query ["SET", key, value]

    json conn, %{ message: "success!"}
  end

  def show(conn, %{"id" => id }) do

    {:ok, client} = Exredis.start_link

    result = client |> Exredis.query ["GET", id]

    json conn, %{ value: result }
  end
end

defmodule PhoenixDiet.Router do
    use PhoenixDiet.Web, :router

    pipeline :api do
      plug :accepts, ["json"]
    end

      # Other scopes may use custom stacks.
    scope "/api", PhoenixDiet do
      pipe_through :api

      resources "/redis", RedisController
      resources "/users", UserController
    end
  end
</pre>

And everything works! Below are some screenshots of the action!
