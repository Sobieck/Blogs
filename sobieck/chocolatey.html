Chocolatey is awesome!

So, I've been messing around a bit with <a href="https://chocolatey.org/">Chocolatey</a> lately. It is a package manager for Windows much like yum on Linux machines which enables easy downloading and installing of applications from the command line. The reason why I've been messing with it is that I tend to play around a lot with many different programming languages. I want to be able to compile and run those programs anywhere I have access to my GitHub repository. Normally this would result in me visiting a bunch of different websites and downloading their installers. With chocolatey it is just a few commands in a powershell window.

Chocolatey makes it extremely easy to define a set of applications that I would like have installed. You just make an XML config document like the one I've defined below (this is what I install on all my machines). And then just run <b>choco install your.config</b> in a administrator powershell window. You must be able to run powershell scripts as chocolatey is built on them.
